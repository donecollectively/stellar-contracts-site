An open-source contract for revenue-sharing 

---

## Sustainable contribution through proactive distribution of rewards

Cooperation can be just a little more difficult without assurance of shared rewards.  Let's make that happen on-chain.

### What does it do?

This rev-sharing contract suite will serve a critical role for cooperatively-created ventures.  

### Requirements

#### It keeps details of relative holdings for each stakeholder
   * so that every participant's share is honored during payouts

#### It allows those holdings to be updated, with certain important constraints
   * more to say here, together with customer requirements

#### It accumulates revenues
  * all the proceeds that are to be redistributed are deposited into the contract

#### It will allow stakeholders to withdraw their portion of the accumulated revenue
  * so they can collect what's rightfully theirs

### Future
