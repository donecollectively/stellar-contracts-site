Open-source vesting contract

## Vesting in the Open

The Stellar Vesting contract is a developing project for long-term contributions with long-term rewards

### What does it do?

This vesting contract suite provides an essential mechanism for incentivizing long-term relationships. 

 A **Sponsor** deposits funds into the contract, with details indicating the payee and terms of the vesting.  

 A **Payee** can then withdraw funds periodically, according to those terms.

#### Future goals

We want to also build in certain mechanisms for governing the long-term lifecycle of the vesting contract.  

These may need to handle cases such as evolving beneficiary-credentials, discontinuance of vesting, accelerated vesting, and escalation paths for dispute resolution.

### How does it work?

TBD - iterative development in progress - thanks @Alex
