Use your native programming language to implement most of your dApp.

## Mostly-javascript dApps for developer efficiency

Switching languages sucks.  Let's do less of that, and make it easier for App developers to be dApp developers.

### Introducing Helios

Helios can introduce itself, but we think it's worthy of our own introduction to it, too.

The smart contracts built in ***the Helios language can express the same domain model*** shared by the entire Cardano developer ecosystem.  Transactions, tokens, addresses, staking keys, utxo's, and so on.

... using syntax that's easier to read and harder to misunderstand.

## Helios On-chain

The Helios on-chain functional contract language is beautifully designed to express just what's essential about Cardano's Plutus runtime execution environment.  

It's a small functional language with ***simple syntax and powerful capability***.  

It compiles natively to onchain Plutus code (UPLC) directly within the Javascript runtime.  No extra build tools. Runs in the browser.

***Helios enables self-sovereign static web applications.***

## Helios Off-Chain APIs

The Helios Typescript API is a bridge to **data structures** defined in your smart contracts and to **activities** that are part of your application's functionality.  It is also a **library** of data-types needed for interacting with on-chain contracts.

Code written using the Helios Typescript API typically reflects the **mechanisms of blockchain interactions**.

## Stellar Contracts and Helios

Stellar Contracts provides a fluent typescript API where you can express the on-chain ***transactions forming the meaning of your dApp***.  We couldn't do it without Helios.

Application code written using Stellar Contracts typically reflects ***semantics of your application*** more strongly than the mechanics of getting them done.

This improves readability and intuition for application developers, creating space for Cardano specialists to do their part of dApp development separately from UI specialists who make it look good.

Stellar Contracts' leverage of the Helios API provides Cardano blockchain developers a great essential toolkit, together with higher-level patterns to follow, forming a ***fluent application-specific domain library*** for every dApp.
