Stellar Contracts are made with Typescript and Helios.

dApp developers with a UI project probably have all the right tooling installed already.  Just use npm to add a couple new modules, and get ready to turbo-charge your app with on-chain smart contracts.

## Getting Started with Stellar
### Basic environment

#### Use Node.js 

Install Node.js for your platform.  We like to use 
[`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#intro)
 for that.  

Or you can follow platform-specific guidance from the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) team to choose a package that suits your development environment and installs easily.  

#### Use `npm` or another favorite package manager

We like `pnpm` a lot.  `npm` or `yarn` are great too.  

Set this up after Node.js is ready.

#### Boost your editor to understand Helios

Helios has a plugin for VS Code you can use to see syntax highlighting and error cues in your on-chain code.  You can [add it anytime](https://www.hyperion-bt.org/helios-book/integrations/vscode.html), so if you're looking for a quick start, you can skip it for now.

### Install

Intrepid? clone [our github repo](https://github.com/donecollectively/stellar-contracts).

Hang tight - we're working through a release-management cycle and a testnet phase before general-availability.  

Soon, you'll simply install using `pnpm add @donecollectively/stellar-contracts`

#### Start with a working boilerplate

Try cloning a working repository, like our [community coin](https://github.com/donecollectively/coco) project.

Modify it at will, make it your own, and update `.git/config` to point to a repo you create on Gitlab or Github.

### Project Based Learning

[Join our learning program](/docs/contributing/join-to-learn)  to get personally introduced to design patterns, great mental models, and concrete opportunities to learn by practice.  

You can also gain certification to be a skilled contributor in the Stellar cooperative and earn a share of project rewards.
