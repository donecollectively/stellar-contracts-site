Objective: Bring Learners to Stellar

-------------

## Keys to Success
### Goals

  * Drive paid signups for the **Learning Stellar Contracts** program

  * Build and retain project credibility, reputation and awareness

### Objectives

  * We are seeking to acquire **300 paid learning-program participants**.

  * We would like to have **10000 unique, quality visitors to our website by July 31, 2023**.

### Expectations

1. Use **your** existing network of contacts and followers
2.  Write content in your own words
3.  Okay to quote or screenshot our website content in your post
4.  Bring qualified traffic: audiences who would have interest in being part of the Stellar project, or who will pay to learn about Stellar Contracts
5. Use your custom affiliate-id in links you share, to ensure you receive payment and cooperative-contributor-credit for visitors you bring to the project
6. You'll receive a portion of every Learning subscription, directly into your wallet. 

### Constraints

1. **Don't spam common spaces**.  _For example, posting to multiple channels in multiple Cardano-related Discord servers **will result in loss of your affiliate rights including revenue**_.  It's fine to post in your own servers, of course.  When in doubt, check with the leadership of the space where you are posting.
2. **Don't misrepresent our project**.  If you're unsure whether a prospect-facing message is saying correct information, just ask.
3. **Don't manufacture controversy** to draw people in.  Okay to create curiosity.
4. **Don't use negativity** about any other project.  Throwing mud makes everyone messy.
5.  **Don't use the Helios project name to promote** Stellar (unless Christian decides it's okay)
6.  **Don't drive junk traffic**.  Quality traffic converts better.

## What you'll do
