Ensure project sustainability by endowing the project treasury and rewarding its creators, its supporters and its community

## Give a little bit

### Supported by end-users

Transactions built with Stellar Contracts can include a small fee for the Stellar cooperative treasury.  Your application works without needing to touch these details, and most of the value-bearing transactions your application does on chain will be implicitly supporting the Stellar community.  

### Supported by developers

When you use our contracts in your dApp, the transaction-building UI includes a small fee.  You can include fees to support your application's treasury, too.  

We think you're going to love Stellar and enjoy knowing that there is a continuing flow of spendable gratitude serving your developer ecosystem.

### Supported by Members

Product-minded people joining the Stellar Product Cooperative will also be supporting the project through their membership contributions, but more importantly, by helping to make Stellar products the best they can be for our collective customers.  

Cooperative contributors will also share access to the revenue pool surplus, in classic cooperative style.  Bigger contributions will lead to more revenue sharing, and ***every contribution counts***.
