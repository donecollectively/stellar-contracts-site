Designing software with Cardano's extended-UTxO model and the essential **on-chain structures of Plutus can be really challenging** for enthusiastic newbies and seasoned full-stack developers, both.  

Our classic mental models of software development don't have an obvious and natural fit with the low-level structures of Cardano minters and validators.  **Stellar Contracts is here to change that**.

We are shining a light on techniques **enabling capabilities modern software developers expect**, showing ways to form cooperating sets of scripts while also enabling fluid on-chain interactions between contracts from completely different projects.  

We'll help you navigate between conflicting mental models like Immutable contracts vs software versioning, and spend-only validation vs reactive program logic.  These challenges can be confusing distractions from achieving your vision, and Stellar Contracts' patterns of **integrated contract composition** will help you get back to getting things done.
